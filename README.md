# Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to review weather conditions in Oahu, Hawaii to convince an investor to help open the shop, Surf n' Shake. Surf n' Shake will sell surf boards and ice cream year round and the investor wanted to insure that the weather will not be a detriment to the business.

## Results

Using precipiation data collected from nine weather stations in Hawaii (n = 2772), the average temperature throughout the year was 72°F, ranging from 54°F to 85°F.

### June
Examining multiple years, June's average temperature is 75°F with a low of 64°F and a high of 85°F.

### December
Examining multiple years, December's average temperature is 71°F with a low of 56°F and a high of 83°F.

The 3 key difference in weather between June and December include:
1. The temperature fluctuates more in December than in June: December's temperatures deviate by 3.75°F while June's deviate by 3.25°F.
2. December's lowest temperature (56°F) is 9°F lower than June's (64°F).
3. June's highest temperature (75°F) is 2°F higher than December's (83°F).

## Summary 
Considering that the low in a summer month and the low in a winter month are only 9°F different and the highs are only 2°F different, temperature does not fluctuate much throughout the year, so Surf n' Shake is a viable business investment.
